Welcome to my professional portfolio!

I’m **Pandiarajan**, a skilled **Production Operator, CNC Programmer, and KUKA Robotic Milling Operator** with hands-on industrial experience across **India, Malaysia, and Saudi Arabia**. I specialize in cable production processes, CNC programming, and robotic machining using **Autodesk PowerMill**.

Over the years, I have worked in diverse manufacturing environments, operating advanced machinery such as **Maillefer**, **Rosendahl**, multi-color extrusion systems, and robotic milling setups. My work focuses on precision, safety, and efficiency—whether I’m optimizing production cycles, troubleshooting machine issues, improving process flow, or ensuring product quality.

I actively apply lean manufacturing principles such as **5S, Kaizen, SMED, and Kanban**, and I’m experienced with **ERP systems (Advairs ERP)** for production tracking and process documentation. My background has allowed me to build strong technical problem-solving skills and the ability to work effectively in fast-paced industrial environments.

This website includes my **CV**, work experience, and other professional information. Thank you for visiting—feel free to explore and reach out if you'd like to connect!
